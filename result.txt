Trinity counters that "Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) says he may be 'the One'," just as the sound of a number being selected alerts Trinity that someone may be tracing their call.
"We have the name of their next target," says the other, "His name is Neo."
On the other end is Morpheus, who informs Neo that they've both run out of time and that "they" are coming for him.
Morpheus tries to guide Neo out of the building but when he is instructed to get on a scaffolding and take it to the roof Neo rejects Morpheus's advice, allowing himself to be taken by the Agents.
Trinity takes Neo to Morpheus.
Morpheus explains that he's been searching for Neo his entire life and asks if Neo feels like "Alice in Wonderland, falling down the rabbit hole."
As the rest of Morpheus's crew straps him into a chair, Neo is told that pill he took is part of a trace program, to "disrupt his input/output carrier signal" so that they can pinpoint him.
Just before Neo passes out Morpheus says to him, "Welcome to the real world."
Neo is introduced to Morpheus's crew including Trinity; Apoc (Julian Arahanga), a man with long, flowing black hair; Switch; Cypher (bald with a goatee); two brawny brothers, Tank (Marcus Chong) and Dozer (Anthony Ray Parker); and a young, thin man named Mouse (Matt Doran).
When Neo wakes up in his bunk, Morpheus is beside him.
Morpheus and Neo stand in a sparring program.
Morpheus bids Neo to hit him, if he can.
Morpheus tells Neo he must free his mind and leaps from one building to the next.
He asks Trinity why, if Morpheus thinks Neo is the One, he hasn't taken him to see the Oracle yet.
Morpheus and Neo are walking down a standard city street in what appears to be the Matrix.
Neo asks what the Agents are.
"Sentient programs," says Morpheus, that "can move in and out of any software hard-wired into their system, meaning that they can take over anyone in the Matrix program.
"Inside the Matrix," Morpheus says, "They are everyone and they are no one."
"What are you trying to tell me," asks Neo, "That I can dodge bullets?"
"When you're ready," Morpheus says, "You won't have to."
Cypher offers Neo a drink and says that he knows what Neo is thinking, "Why, oh why didn't I take the blue pill?"
Cypher asks Neo if Morpheus has told him why he's here.
Morpheus interrupts the meal, announcing that he's taking Neo to see the Oracle.
Morpheus, Trinity, Neo, Apoc, Switch, Mouse and Cypher are jacked into the Matrix.
She tells Neo that either he or Morpheus will die, and that Neo will have the power to choose which one it will be.
"Deja vu," he says, which gets the attention of Trinity and Morpheus.
Morpheus, who is above Neo in the walls, breaks through the wall and lands on the agent, yelling to Trinity to get Neo out of the building.
Cypher returns to the Nebuchadnezzar before Trinity, Neo, Switch and Apoc.
She falls down dead before Trinity and Neo.
"I'm not the One, Trinity," Neo says, relaying his understanding of the discussion with the Oracle: she did not enlighten him as to whether he was the promised messiah.
And, since Morpheus was willing to sacrifice himself, Neo knows that he must do that same.
Neo says he only knows that he can bring Morpheus out.
"Neo," protests Trinity, "No one has ever done anything like this."
"Trinity," yells Neo, "Help!"
Trinity brings the helicopter down to the floor that Morpheus is on and Neo opens fire on the three Agents.
Unable to control the helicopter, Trinity miraculously gets it close enough to drop Morpheus and Neo on a rooftop.
Neo hauls Trinity up to them.
Neo tries to tell him that the Oracle told him the opposite but Morpheus says, "She told you exactly what you needed to hear."
Meanwhile, as the phone rings, providing Trinity's exit, she confides to Neo that everything that the Oracle has told her has come true, except for one thing.
Instead of running, which Trinity implores him to do as she looks on from the ship, Neo turns to face Smith.
They trade some thunderous blows with Smith hitting Neo so hard he spits up blood in the Matrix and in the chair aboard the ship.
"My name," he replies, "is Neo."
Trinity reminds Morpheus that they can't use the EMP while Neo is in the Matrix.
"I know, Trinity, don't worry," says Morpheus, "He's going to make it."
He kicks in a door and rushes through an apartment complex where the Agents appropriate more bodies, including that of a sweet little old lady who throws a knife at Neo as Agent Smith.
"Neo," she says, "I'm not afraid anymore.
In the Matrix world, Neo hangs up the phone.
