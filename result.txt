"We have the name of their next target," says the other, "His name is Neo."
Trinity takes Neo to Morpheus.
Morpheus explains that he's been searching for Neo his entire life and asks if Neo feels like "Alice in Wonderland, falling down the rabbit hole."
Just before Neo passes out Morpheus says to him, "Welcome to the real world."
Neo is introduced to Morpheus's crew including Trinity; Apoc (Julian Arahanga), a man with long, flowing black hair; Switch; Cypher (bald with a goatee); two brawny brothers, Tank (Marcus Chong) and Dozer (Anthony Ray Parker); and a young, thin man named Mouse (Matt Doran).
He asks Trinity why, if Morpheus thinks Neo is the One, he hasn't taken him to see the Oracle yet.
Morpheus and Neo are walking down a standard city street in what appears to be the Matrix.
"Inside the Matrix," Morpheus says, "They are everyone and they are no one."
"What are you trying to tell me," asks Neo, "That I can dodge bullets?"
Cypher offers Neo a drink and says that he knows what Neo is thinking, "Why, oh why didn't I take the blue pill?"
Cypher asks Neo if Morpheus has told him why he's here.
Morpheus, Trinity, Neo, Apoc, Switch, Mouse and Cypher are jacked into the Matrix.
Morpheus, who is above Neo in the walls, breaks through the wall and lands on the agent, yelling to Trinity to get Neo out of the building.
Cypher returns to the Nebuchadnezzar before Trinity, Neo, Switch and Apoc.
Neo says he only knows that he can bring Morpheus out.
"Neo," protests Trinity, "No one has ever done anything like this."
"Trinity," yells Neo, "Help!"
Trinity brings the helicopter down to the floor that Morpheus is on and Neo opens fire on the three Agents.
Unable to control the helicopter, Trinity miraculously gets it close enough to drop Morpheus and Neo on a rooftop.
Neo tries to tell him that the Oracle told him the opposite but Morpheus says, "She told you exactly what you needed to hear."
Instead of running, which Trinity implores him to do as she looks on from the ship, Neo turns to face Smith.
Trinity reminds Morpheus that they can't use the EMP while Neo is in the Matrix.
"I know, Trinity, don't worry," says Morpheus, "He's going to make it."
