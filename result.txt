data scienc is an interdisciplinari field that use scientif method , process , algorithm and system to extract knowledg and insight from data in variou form , both structur and unstructur , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] similar to data mine . \ndata scienc is a `` concept to unifi statist , data analysi , machin learn and their relat method '' in order to `` understand and analyz actual phenomena '' with data . [ 3 ] It employ techniqu and theori drawn from mani field within the context of mathemat , statist , inform scienc , and comput scienc . \n ture award winner jim gray imagin data scienc as a `` fourth paradigm '' of scienc ( empir , theoret , comput and now data-driven ) and assert that `` everyth about scienc is chang becaus of the impact of inform technolog '' and the data deluge.\n In 2012 , when harvard busi review call it `` the sexiest job of the 21st centuri '' , [ 6 ] the term `` data scienc '' becam a buzzword .
